My Ender 5 Plus upgrades and mods

This repository contains all the details of my Creality Ender 5+ upgrades and mods from stock to a fully enclosed, corexy, heated chamber, external part cooled, water-cooled 3d printer, capable of printing with high temperature engineering materials.

The upgrades and mods comprise some quality of life as well as essential and required items and are listed in the order that I completed them.

Please note that my upgrades and mods are work in progress, so not all the upgrades and mods have been completed yet and so these documents will be updated as I go.

Please read "Mod List" for a list of the mods and to see if a particular mod has been completed yet.
